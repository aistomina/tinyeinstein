                    Children in early preschool at Tiny Einstein, spend their
                    days exploring, sharing and learning. Let us help your
                    2-year-old develop his or her independence and confidence
                    in a cultural, affectionate setting that is familiar to them
                    and that encourages a sense of a bilingual community. We help
                    them adapt to new school routines and rituals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We plan your child's activities based on a program grounded
                    in early childhood fundamentals and combining the best of
                    Russian academics and traditions and the American way of
                    life. Your young learner will increase her language
                    ability, practice early counting skills and learn to
                    cooperate with friends through group activities. She
                    will take on greater physical challenges and begin to
                    communicate more effectively with adults. Our center
                    offers age-appropriate toys and materials that help
                    your toddler develop a love of learning. We teach
                    toddlers through exposure to colors and different
                    properties, block building, basic puzzles, creative
                    games, while we work with them, in Russian and English.
                    We balance fun and learning through dress up and discovery
                    of their transformation in a mirror and manipulating props,
                    such as kitchenware, in the dramatic play area.

                    Tiny Einstein ensures that kids have enough time to be
                    active outdoors and develop gross motor skills. Our loving
                    specialist teachers keep toddlers engaged through singing,
                    dancing and mimicking, art and science, story telling, sand
                    and water play, and playtime with cause-and-effect toys.

                    In a safe and loving environment, your little adventurer
                    will find his Russian and American voice, make new friends

                    Preschool kids at Tiny Einstein are in the process of
                    becoming confident learners. They recognize their own name
                    and other letters in print in Russian and English. They show
                    a genuine interest in reading books with an adult and
                    recall events from previous activities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We take their confidence to the next level with hands-on
                    education. Your 3- to 4-year-old child is ready for
                    structured learning activities that touch on early literacy
                    in Russian and English, Math, Science and Social Studies.
                    Our program balances these subjects as we develop their
                    interests and skills in Russian and English, with a focus
                    on encouraging writing early on in preschool.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are ample opportunities for independent exploration
                    and a healthy dose of outdoor play to build those gross
                    motor skills and friendships. Along with etiquette, problem
                    solving skills and social emotional learning, our specialist
                    teachers bring to the students – music, art, science, folk
                    tales and theatre and gymnastics. The age appropriate
                    classroom material is constantly rotated and updated to
                    keep up the curiosity and interest as children learn while
                    they play. They continue to feel comforted by the
                    familiarity of their culture at school, especially as they
                    reach an age where they thrive, absorb and learn in a
                    structured setting. Our center continues to give them the
                    best of both worlds – Russian traditions amidst an American
                    setting.

                    Pre Kindergarteners at Tiny Einstein are nearly ready for
                    school. We give small-group lessons in Math, Russian and
                    English literacy every day. We promote reading in English
                    and Russian, Arithmetic, Science, Social Studies,
                    storytelling and recall, participating in show and tell and
                    strong writing skills. The center wants to ensure that they
                    have benefitted from the highly respected academic
                    orientation of Russian culture and the American ability to
                    explore and articulate their thoughts. They're eager to
                    recall events from a story and describe details, precursors
                    for public speaking. We prepare children with lessons on
                    words and spelling in both the languages, using the Russian
                    reading technique, mental math concepts and valuable social
                    skills. They become confident of their dual identities and
                    well versed in Russian traditions and the American way of
                    life.

                    It's not all work and no play.  At Tiny Einstein there is
                    plenty of time for independent indoor and outdoor play,
                    gymnastics, science, folk tales and theatre, art and music,
                    as well as small and large group activities, daily.
                    Children also have free play opportunities to socialize and
                    exercise their energetic bodies. Our comprehensive bilingual
                    and bi-culture program makes sure to keep your child
                    excited about school.

                    final stretch toward kindergarten, with a well thought out
                    readiness aspect to the curriculum. With our expert
                    educators guiding the way, your child will feel confident,
