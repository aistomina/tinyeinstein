      <h2>THE FACILITY AND PROGRAMS</h2>

      <p>
        Our brand-new, ultra modern preschool has large class rooms and a
        bright, sunny, outdoor play area. The Tiny Einstein Center for
        Child Development provides a wide variety of bilingual material,
        including provisions for dramatic play, math, literacy, art,
        science, music, kinesthetics, physical education, and gymnastics.
      </P>
      <p>
        Our students enjoy the specialist teachers we bring in, to enrich
        this diverse curriculum in both languages and cultures. We strive
        to create an environment where the children are stimulated and
        excited to learn indoors and outdoors, in a space that is clean,
        organized, and constantly being renewed with new age appropriate
        materials. It is our goal to have each child leave us not only
        well grounded in Russian culture, but also with excellent
        concentration, a good sense of order, a desire to explore,
        and a genuine love of learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        The academic areas are regularly renewed to maintain peak
        interest and excitement. Art projects, fun worksheets, music
        time, out door play, kinesthetic material and story time are
        all incorporated into the daily routine.â€‹ The experienced teachers
        understand that creativity and scientific inquiry begin with
        curiosity. That's why they nourish our students' sense of wonder.
