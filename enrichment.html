                    This is an integral class to our philosophy of cultivating
                    the best in our children and raising well rounded
                    individuals whom will be better suited for life's
                    challenges.

                    Preschoolers are at an ideal age to expand
                    their musical horizons and abilities. Experts have found
                    that kids who grow up hearing music, singing songs, and
                    moving to the beat are better equipped at creating more
                    pathways or neural connections between the cells in their
                    brains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Research shows that kids who are actively encouraged
                    in music do better in reading and math, are better able to
                    focus and control their bodies, play better with others and
                    have higher self-esteem. These are the reasons why we take
                    pride in our musical program. Our music classes introduce
                    children to Russian songs that they would never be able to
                    get in a formal education otherwise here in the States,
                    as well as classic children's melodies and songs in English.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Throughout the course of the year, children are introduced
                    to different musical instruments, listen to classical music
                    and play beat and rhythm games geared towards developing
                    a sense of melody and rhythm.

                    We take pride in training our children to be great
                    thinkers from an early age! Our young minds not only have
                    fun in the classroom, but also develop critical reasoning
                    skills and a genuine understanding of the logical processes
                    required to solve math problems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Along with the rigor and strength of the traditional
                    Russian mathematical teachings, our math program helps
                    students develop advanced problem-solving skills in an
                    interactive environment full of fun games, stories and
                    puzzles. The emphasis is on logical thinking, abstract
                    reasoning, mental arithmetic and an understanding of
                    mathematical tools.

                  <p>
                    Our goal  is to foster  complex reasoning skills so that
                    our students will have an advantage in their academic and
                    professional careers:  to learn to think as many of the
                    brightest minds do – with the precision of a scientist or
                    a doctor and the creativity of a novelist or a composer!

                    upon their excitement about the natural world! For young
                    learners science is constant examination of their everyday
                    world. We don’t have to teach young children how to wonder,
                    discover, and explore through play because they do it
                    naturally.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Science has always been fun for children if
                    presented in a language and method tailored to their needs
                    and interests. We introduce  amazing experiences that
                    encourage discovery through playful exploration. In science
                    classes at Tiny Einstein, our teachers have the opportunity
                    to create meaningful experiences that will have a lasting
                    impact on our students throughout their entire school
                    experience; fostering a desire to learn more about their
                    natural worlds and expand on their desire to be the
                    scientists they naturally are for the rest of their lives.

                    If the science demonstration served its intended purpose,
                    the students will come alive with a stream of questions.
                    We encourage and explore their questions with full
                    capabilities of the scientific method.That is what we
                    encourage at our center - to help the young scientists
                    turn their questions into an unforgettable learning
                    experience that will last them their entire life.

                    We encourage our children to get to know and expand all
                    of their bodies abilities and capabilities right from the
                    start! Early childhood is the crucial time to build the
                    basic skills that are the foundation for more complex
                    movement  later in life. Children need to develop their
                    body’s spatial awareness and practice their emerging motor
                    skills.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We assist children in  developing an awareness of their
                    bodies in relation to their own balance, strength and
                    coordination. The psychological benefits of age appropriate
                    exercise and games are just as important as the physical
                    ones. Not to be overlooked are the positive effects of
                    physical activity on self-image and self-confidence, and
                    on promoting general feelings of health and wellness.

                    An active student can sit still or stay focused on academics
                    for much longer than an inactive student. Our fun filled
                    PE classes are a big hit with our students and create
                    confident capable movers and shakers!

                  <p>
                    Articulation is the ability to make sounds clearly.
                    By the age of four a child should be 100% intelligible
                    even if they continue to have some articulation errors.
                    Unclear speech can impact significantly  how well a child
                    can interact with adults and peers and can affect the
                    development of thier language and social skills. A child
                    who is having difficulties being understood can become
                    frustrated and angry which may lead to behavioral issues.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Articulation is also important in literacy skills such as
                    reading and spelling out words. In order to be able to
                    express basic needs and wants, right through to being able
                    to engage in complex conversations, clear speech and
                    pronunciation is critical. Our speech enhancement classes
                    are conducted in a relaxed, fun filled atmosphere with
                    age appropriate material. Our task is to improve Russian
                    and English pronunciation in our students, leading to
                    improved self confidence, independence, better social skills
                    and provide a good grounding for reading and spelling.

                     Our special Pre-K program focuses on ensuring that every
                     child meets our highest academic standards. We make sure
                     that students graduating from our nurturing program have
                     advanced reading and writing acquisition, fluency in dual
                     languages, artistic and creative influences, adequate
                     social and emotional skills,, behavior regulation, and
                     independent self-help skills. At the same time they gain
                     the accountability that is required to walk into a
                     Kindergarten classroom confidently while proudly being
                     enthusiastic about learning.

                     This enthusiasm for a life long passion for education we
                     carefully instill in their young minds and tender hearts .
                     We achieve this through our program, which is centered
                     around furthering our children’s joy of learning and
                     enabling the enthusiasm our children have to learn new
                     skills, while at the same time allowing them to have
                     confidence in their abilities when acquiring new abilities
                     and working through new challenges. We take example from
                     our namesake once again and enable the children's joy and
                     natural curiosity as best we can while preparing them for
                     the highest in academic standards.
