        Developing Independence and Confidence, amidst the comfort
        of their traditional language.
      </p>
      <p>
        Children in early preschool at Tiny Einstein, spend their
        days exploring, sharing and learning. Let us help your
        2-year-old develop his or her independence and confidence
        in a cultural, affectionate setting that is familiar to them
        and that encourages a sense of a bilingual community. We help
        them adapt to new school routines and rituals.
      </p>
      <p>
        We plan your child's activities based on a program grounded
        in early childhood fundamentals and combining the best of
        Russian academics and traditions and the American way of
        life. Your young learner will increase her language
        ability, practice early counting skills and learn to
        cooperate with friends through group activities. She
        will take on greater physical challenges and begin to
        communicate more effectively with adults. Our center
        offers age-appropriate toys and materials that help
        your toddler develop a love of learning. We teach
        toddlers through exposure to colors and different
        properties, block building, basic puzzles, creative
        games, while we work with them, in Russian and English.
        We balance fun and learning through dress up and discovery
        of their transformation in a mirror and manipulating props,
        such as kitchenware, in the dramatic play area.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tiny Einstein ensures that kids have enough time to be
        active outdoors and develop gross motor skills. Our loving
        specialist teachers keep toddlers engaged through singing,
        dancing and mimicking, art and science, story telling, sand
        and water play, and playtime with cause-and-effect toys.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a safe and loving environment, your little adventurer
        will find his Russian and American voice, make new friends
        and develop confidence in newfound abilities.

        Structured Learning, Exploration and Guided Play
      </p>
      <p>
        Preschool kids at Tiny Einstein are in the process of
        becoming confident learners. They recognize their own name
        and other letters in print in Russian and English. They show
        a genuine interest in reading books with an adult and
        recall events from previous activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        We take their confidence to the next level with hands-on
        education. Your 3- to 4-year-old child is ready for
        structured learning activities that touch on early literacy
        in Russian and English, Math, Science and Social Studies.
        Our program balances these subjects as we develop their
        interests and skills in Russian and English, with a focus
        on encouraging writing early on in preschool.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are ample opportunities for independent exploration
        and a healthy dose of outdoor play to build those gross
        motor skills and friendships. Along with etiquette, problem
        solving skills and social emotional learning, our specialist
        teachers bring to the students – music, art, science, folk
        tales and theatre and gymnastics. The age appropriate
        classroom material is constantly rotated and updated to
        keep up the curiosity and interest as children learn while
        they play. They continue to feel comforted by the
        familiarity of their culture at school, especially as they
        reach an age where they thrive, absorb and learn in a
        structured setting. Our center continues to give them the
        best of both worlds – Russian traditions amidst an American
        setting.

        Lots of Learning and Plenty of Play
      </p>
      <p>
        Pre Kindergarteners at Tiny Einstein are nearly ready for
        school. We give small-group lessons in Math, Russian and
        English literacy every day. We promote reading in English
        and Russian, Arithmetic, Science, Social Studies,
        storytelling and recall, participating in show and tell and
        strong writing skills. The center wants to ensure that they
        have benefitted from the highly respected academic
        orientation of Russian culture and the American ability to
        explore and articulate their thoughts. They're eager to
        recall events from a story and describe details, precursors
        for public speaking. We prepare children with lessons on
        words and spelling in both the languages, using the Russian
        reading technique, mental math concepts and valuable social
        skills. They become confident of their dual identities and
        well versed in Russian traditions and the American way of
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not all work and no play.  At Tiny Einstein there is
        plenty of time for independent indoor and outdoor play,
        gymnastics, science, folk tales and theatre, art and music,
        as well as small and large group activities, daily.
        Children also have free play opportunities to socialize and
        exercise their energetic bodies. Our comprehensive bilingual
        and bi-culture program makes sure to keep your child
        excited about school.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let Tiny Einstein guide your young learner through the
        final stretch toward kindergarten, with a well thought out
        readiness aspect to the curriculum. With our expert
        educators guiding the way, your child will feel confident,
        communicative and emotionally ready to take the big step
        into the kindergarten classroom, along with having got a
        strong grounding in Russian culture. With lower
        student-to-teacher ratios, each child gets more individual
        attention.
