      <p>
        True learning can only be achieved when the child feels
        secure, loved and accepted in the school environment. Our
        belief is to unify the cognitive, social-emotional, and
        physical dimensions of our students to enable them to learn
        in the most contemporary ways.
      </p>

        The loving faculty consisting of native Russian speakers and
        English speaking teachers, is informed by current research.
        Studies show that bilingual children display more creativity
        in problem-solving skills and possess a greater sensitivity
        to cognitive flexibility such as divergent thinking, concept
        formation, verbal abilities and general reasoning. A second
        language enables children to reinforce reading and writing
        skills as well as comprehension in their native language,
        along with a deep understanding of and appreciation for their
        own and other cultures. And what’s more, it gives them a head start in
        language requirements for later school and college and offers
        them increased educational and career opportunities.

        We know that our students learn best by doing and we place
        a strong emphasis on developing their natural curiosity
        with the aim of graduating confident and joyful learners.
        We encourage traits such as academic rigor, risk-taking,
        resilience and creativity. Our alumni parents tell us that
        our center has done a stellar job of producing students who
        thrive at their next school, and at the same time maintain
        a deep connection with the Russian language.
        We are inspired by and integrate components of several
        philosophies into our program, including the strengths of
        Traditional Russian Schooling, Reggio Emilia, and elements
        of the Montessori method.

      <p>
        We respect each child's unique learning style, abilities
        and developmental level. We believe that hands-on learning,
        where the curriculum can emerge from the children's
        interests, needs and desires, allows a child to learn in a
        way that is concrete and meaningful and consistent with
        child development experts.

        Tiny Einstein Child development Center’s enrichment programs
        are customized to the center’s bilingual and bicultural
        curriculum and allow each of our toddlers to tap into their
        inherent talent and reach their highest potential. Along
        with the building of academic and cultural skills, our
        programs and activities impart 21st century skills of
        positive social interaction and collaboration.
